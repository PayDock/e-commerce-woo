This plugin contains compile and non compile js code, if you need customize something. Code that need compile for working with woocommerce block in `/resource` path.
In root dir you can find `webpack.config.js` file, its default config for compile front-end js, but you can use it as a starting point to create your own configuration.
Also, we use helper code that not need compile what contained in assets path.
